<We See You>
  
A quiet game about choices, silence, and being seen.
In this game, you step into the story of a student navigating the unspoken codes of opportunity—applications, rejections, performance, and the subtle rules that shape belonging.
Each decision branches from emotion, not strategy. Whether you apply or not, speak or stay silent, the game holds space for all paths.
This is not a game to win.
It’s a space to feel your way through.
To be seen—even when you don’t say a word.
